# MAE277-project
In this project, we explored different control methods on a Spring connected double pendulum system.

The control methods implemented were State Observer Feedback control with Integral action, along with Feed forward control and Repetitive Control

In each folder, you will find the corresponding .slx (simulink) and .m (script) files.
In the simulation folder, you can find the main code to run the simulation and the corresponding simulink block diagram.
In the plot foler, you can find the .m codes for visualization and comparing controller performances.
In the reference folder, there is a zip where we referred to prof. Tsao's written code from MAE 277
